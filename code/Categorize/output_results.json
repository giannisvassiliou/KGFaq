He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a professor of physics at Florida State University and the University of Miami, and a 1933 Nobel Prize recipient. Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\". He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics. Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote: \"I am toiling over Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.\" In another letter concerning Compton effect, he wrote: \"I don't understand details about Dirac at all.\"",

They are considered one of the most influential rock bands of the 20th century and have sold over 100 million records worldwide. The Who made significant contributions to rock music, including the development of the Marshall Stack, large PA systems, synthesizers, influential playing styles by Entwistle and Moon, Townshend's feedback and power chord guitar technique, as well as the creation of rock operas. They have influenced many hard rock, punk rock, power pop, and mod bands. The Who's songs are still regularly played today. In 1990, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band originated from a previous group called \"The Detours\" before establishing themselves as part of the pop art and mod movements by incorporating auto-destructive art into their performances through destroying guitars and drums on stage. Their first single as \"The Who\", titled \"I Can't Explain\" (1965), reached the top ten charts in the UK followed by several hit singles such as \"My Generation\" (1965), \"Substitute\" (1966), and \"Happy Jack\" (1966).",
