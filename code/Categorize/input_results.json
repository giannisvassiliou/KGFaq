The plot revolves around a doctor who is shocked when his wife reveals that she had considered having an affair. He embarks on a night-long adventure that includes infiltrating a masked orgy of an unnamed secret society. Kubrick obtained the filming rights for \"Dream Story\" in the 1960s and revived the project in the 1990s with writer Frederic Raphael's help.\n\nThe film was mostly shot in England but includes detailed recreations of exterior Greenwich Village street scenes made at Pinewood Studios. Its production lasted for 400 days, which holds the Guinness World Record for the longest continuous film shoot. Kubrick died six days after showing Warner Bros. the final cut of \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" considering it his greatest contribution to cinema.\n\nTo ensure a theatrical R rating in the United States, Warner Bros. digitally altered several sexually explicit scenes during post-production. The altered version was released on July 16, 1999, receiving moderately positive reactions from film critics. The worldwide box office receipts reached approximately $162 million, making it Kubrick's highest-grossing film.\n\nThe uncut version"

He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, a professor of physics at Florida State University and the University of Miami, and a 1933 Nobel Prize recipient. Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both quantum mechanics and quantum electrodynamics. Among other discoveries, he formulated the Dirac equation which describes the behaviour of fermions and predicted the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Erwin Schr√∂dinger \"for the discovery of new productive forms of atomic theory\". He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics. Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to Paul Ehrenfest, Albert Einstein wrote: \"I am toiling over Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful.\" In another letter concerning Compton effect, he wrote: \"I don't understand details about Dirac at all.\""

The term \"civil engineering\" has been used since the early 19th century but this branch of engineering has been practiced much earlier by military engineers (roads, canals, and ports were already being built in Roman times). In the 18th century, most European monarchies (France being the pioneer) had formed groups of specialized military engineers in road construction, bridges, ports improvement. Towards the end of the 18th century Jean-Rodolphe Perronet founded the first fully independent specialized school not associated with the army (hence civil): √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es (School of Bridges and Roads) in Paris. Gradually other military engineers from different places founded civil schools in their respective countries such as Agust√≠n de Betancourt who founded Escuela de Ingenieros de Caminos de Madrid in 1802.\n\nIn Czech: Stavebnictv√≠ je specializovan√© hospod√°≈ôsk√© odvƒõtv√≠ zab√Ωvaj√≠c√≠ se stavbami.\n\nIn Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸáŸÜÿØÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿØŸÜŸäÿ© ÿ™ÿπÿ™ÿ®ÿ± ŸÅÿ±ÿπŸãÿß ŸÖŸÜ"
